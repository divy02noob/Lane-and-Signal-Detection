# Lane-and-Signal-Detection
An OpenCV major project to detect lanes and signals in order to aid the driver, helping create autonomous cars.
# Detection of Signal and Lane in Self-Driving Cars 🚗🛣️

This repository contains a comprehensive report and proof-of-concept implementation focused on detecting lane markings and traffic signals using computer vision techniques. The project demonstrates how traditional image processing methods and modern deep learning architectures can be combined to improve the safety and accuracy of autonomous driving systems.

## 📄 Project Overview

Autonomous vehicles rely on robust perception systems to navigate safely. Two critical components of this system are:

- **Lane Detection**: Ensures the vehicle stays centered and follows the correct path.
- **Traffic Signal Detection**: Allows the vehicle to recognize and respond appropriately to red, yellow, and green lights.

This project uses **OpenCV**, along with optional deep learning enhancements, to detect and classify both signals and lanes in real-time video streams.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV 4.x**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
- **(Optional) TensorFlow / PyTorch** for deep learning components
